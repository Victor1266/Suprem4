To compile the SUPREM-IV.GS code and install the files, several changes
to the Makefile may be required.  The Makefile is documented to help
you decide what changes to make where.

This tape contains the source code and data files for SUPREM-IV.  To compile
the code, several changes to the Makefile may be required.

Additional changes may be required to the file src/include/sysdep.h.

1) The SYS variable should be changed to reflect the appropriate system
type.  BSD and SYSV are the most common.  There are several changes that
may also be appropriate on vector hardware.

Please note that in addition to C a few routines are written in FORTRAN
so you will need a FORTRAN compiler as well as C.

2) The Makefile variables MANDIR, KEYFILE, MODELFILE, and IMPFILE should
be changed to be the correct path to these data files.  They can all be
overridden with an environment variable if desired.

A Bourne shell script called suprem4gs has been included in this
distribution.  I would suggest that the actual program and data
files be stored under a non-system directory available to the
person will be responsible for the program and that the suprem4gs
file be edited to point to that directory.  If suprem4gs is then
placed in a bin directory in most user's PATH (i.e. /usr/local/bin)
updates and modifications become much simpler.

3) One of three graphics options is supported and must be chosen at 
compile time.  First are two X windows tools, one for R4 and one for R3.
Both packages support postscript, hpgl, and idraw for hardcopy.  The third
package is for gplot, the graphics package from Stanford which supports
a wide variety of terminals and harcopy devices. 

Additional changes may be required to the file include/sysdep.h.

Also please be careful in the finel directory.  There is a mix of fortran
and C used, and you have to make sure the names are mapped correctly.
